2-dimensional arras can be represented in terms of vectors as "vector of vectors"
Why do we need such a replacement?
ans- because due to an unknown excess to the out of bound memor location causes probe in arrays
Memory for arrays is allocated at compile time on the stack. The stack has a relatively small storage capacity but can be accessed fast.

Memory for vectors, on the other hand, is allocated at runtime on the heap. 
The heap has larger storage capacity compared to the stack but has more access time.

As a result allocating a large 2D array on the stack could lead to the a stack overflow due to the size of the array
being too large to store resulting in a segmentation fault.

/*
int main()
{
int arr[m][n];
//this above declaration is same as:
vector<vector<int> >arr(m,vector<int>(n)); 

}
