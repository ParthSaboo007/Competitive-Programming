To get input of a string preceeded by a number follow these steps;

Note:  we can use getline() but BEWARE not to use cin>> before that as >> does not clear the buffer, so getline() will consider the '\n' (enter)
        key that you pressed after using cin>> as the input string and will immediately be executed as an empty string.
        So, use getchar() or getc(stdin) before getline() to clear the buffer!!

int main()
{
int t;
cin>>t;
string s;
getchar();  // or use getc(stdin)
getline(cin,s);
}
