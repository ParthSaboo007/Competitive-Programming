Consider 2 sways
eg1:{
string s;
char c;
getline(cin,s);
int t;cin>>t;
for(Int i=0;i<t;i++)
{
s+=c;
}
cout<<s;
}

Beware: In line 9: replace (s+=c)-->(s=s+c) and you are going to encounter a Time Limt Error in long strings.  
I don't know why but anyone who could sort this out then do notify me by contributing to this repository.
Till that BEWARE of this fact!!
